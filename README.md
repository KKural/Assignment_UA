# Assignment_UA

This repository contains a Mediterranean network analysis project for the assignment. The Tool folder contains custom ArcGIS Python toolboxes that prepare the data (reading city and edge CSVs), calculate network metrics (using NetworkX), and generate separate city layers (Diplomatic, Trade, Combined) with proportional symbology and top‚Äê20 labeling. Meanwhile, the Output files folder stores all resulting data and visualizations, including tables, maps, and animated GIFs illustrating the evolution of diplomatic and trade connections across the region.
